# C++ Windows Terminal Snake Game 1.0

Hi!

This is a recreation of Snake made in pure C++ without any graphical library, only using ASCII character!

This was developed using the object-oriented side of C++.

# If i want to see the code and use it?

You can use this repository for everything you want!

I advise you to use Dev C++ for open the project.

Have Fun!
